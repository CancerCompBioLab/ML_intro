# ML_intro
Machine Learning introduction


## Pre-requisite

For this list of tutorials, you will need some python package:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- tensorflow
...

You can manually install them, but the easiest way is to create a conda environment with all the required package listed in the `.yml` file:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

If you don't have conda (or miniconda), you can download it [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/)

and you then enter the enviornment with

`conda activate ml_intro_vhio`
